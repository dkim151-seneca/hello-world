Hello people,
This is my first post on the GitHub, and I was asked to say something about my self.
I'm 36y.o. and I am a student on CNS program at Seneca College. Before that I had been working in IT for more than 18 years.
The plan for near future is to get some certifications in networking, cloud, and deployment.

Hope that some time later I could contribute to the society and share some knowledge.

Kind regards to everyone,
Danil Kim
